# Windows Desktop Modernization. Guidance and Samples

This repo contains valuable information to help you modernize your .NET desktop applications. 

## Modernization topics

We are considering the next *high level* topics, feel free to suggest new ones in our issues section

### Port apps to .NET Core 3

Options to convert WPF and WinForms projects based on .NET Framework to .NET Core 3.

### Using Windows 10 features

Windows 10 include a number of APIs that are accessible from the Windows SDK. You can use these APIs in .NET apps by using the Windows.Contracts NuGet package. [More information](/docs/win10apis/README.md) 

### Data Access

ADO.NET can be used in .NET Core 3 applications, however not all the data source providers are available. 

We have plans to support Entity Framework 6 in Core, and Entity Framework Core is already supported.

### Connecting to Services

WCF has been partially ported to .NET Core 3. There is no support for WCF server. WCF clients features are documented here.
